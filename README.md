# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is an application that allows users to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js back end to store and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Users can organize their thoughts, keep track of tasks, and easily access their saved notes. The code was made from starter code installed from edx bootcamp where I added a server for.
